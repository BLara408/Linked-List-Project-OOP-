# Linked-List-Project-OOP-
Object oriented program to add people objects to a linked list data structure

This project uses custom types and Object Oriented design.
This is used to demonstrate how you can use a linked-list data structure coded from scratch to organize objects.
In this project we make people objects and store them in a linked list with a set of commands for each person.
